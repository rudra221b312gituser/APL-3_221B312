### **Design Pattern Definition**  
A **design pattern** is a **standardized solution** to a **recurring problem** in software development. It provides a **structured approach** to solving common issues within a specific **context or circumstance**.

----

## **Singleton Pattern**
The **Singleton pattern** ensures that a class has only **one instance** and provides a **global point of access** to that instance.

### **Use Cases:**
- **Database connection management**
- **Logging framework**
- **Configuration settings**
- **Thread pool management**

---

## **Eager Initialization (Eager Singleton)**
In **eager initialization**, the singleton instance is **created at the time of class loading**, even if it is never used.

### **Code Example (Eager Singleton)**


```java
class EagerSingleton {
    // Instance is created at class loading
    private static final EagerSingleton INSTANCE = new EagerSingleton();

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private EagerSingleton() {}

    // Public method to provide access to the instance
    public static EagerSingleton getInstance() {
        return INSTANCE;
    }
}
```

### **Problem with Eager Initialization**
- **Memory waste:** If the singleton is never used, it still consumes memory.
- **Unnecessary resource consumption:** The object is created even if it is not needed, leading to inefficient resource usage.

---

## **Lazy Initialization (Lazy Singleton)**
In **lazy initialization**, the instance is **created only when it is first requested**.

### **Code Example (Lazy Singleton)**
```java
class LazySingleton {
    // Instance is not created initially
    private static LazySingleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private LazySingleton() {}

    // Public method to provide access to the instance
    public static LazySingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) { // Only create when needed
            instance = new LazySingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### **Problem with Lazy Initialization**
- **Thread safety issue:** If multiple threads access `getInstance()` simultaneously, **multiple instances** could be created.
- **Solution:** Use **synchronized** or **Double-Checked Locking** for thread safety.

---

## **Thread-Safe Singleton (Double-Checked Locking)**
To fix the **thread-safety issue** in the **lazy approach**, we use **double-checked locking**.

### **Code Example (Thread-Safe Lazy Singleton)**
```java
class ThreadSafeSingleton {
    private static volatile ThreadSafeSingleton instance;

    private ThreadSafeSingleton() {}

    public static ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {  // First check (no locking)
            synchronized (ThreadSafeSingleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {  // Second check (with locking)
                    instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## **Comparison of Eager vs. Lazy**
| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Eager Initialization** | Simple, thread-safe, no synchronization overhead | Wastes memory if instance is unused |
| **Lazy Initialization** | Saves memory, initializes only when needed | Not thread-safe (unless synchronized) |
| **Thread-Safe Lazy** | Efficient, prevents multiple instances in multithreading | Slightly complex due to synchronization overhead |
