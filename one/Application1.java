1. Test for Inheritance
Make a class Mother with int x and void show ( ) as its members. Now create another 
class Child that is derived from the Mother class. Create another class Application to 
test the inheritance. 
class Mother {.......}
class Child extends Mother {// Empty Body } Note: “//” is used for single line comments 
 in java.
class Application {
 public static void main (String args[]){
 Mother m= new Mother ( );
 m.show( ); // show of Mother is called
 Child ch=new Child ( ); 
 ch. show ( ); // show ( ) inherited in Child from Mother is called
 }
